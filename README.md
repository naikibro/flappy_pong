![tech stack](t.png)
## Introduction

Welcome to the MUX101 project repository for the "Interfaces Homme Machines et Multim√©dia" course at CNAM PF. This project, developed by Vaanaiki Brotherson, is a hybrid game combining elements of Pong and Flappy Bird using Java and Processing.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an engaging and entertaining game that merges the classic Pong and Flappy Bird concepts. The result is a unique gaming experience that challenges players' reflexes and coordination.

## Tech Stack

- **Java:** The primary programming language used for the game logic and mechanics.
- **Processing:** A flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. It is used for rendering graphics and creating an interactive user interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Processing IDE

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naikibro/flappy_pong
```

## Running the Game

    Open the project in the Processing IDE.
    Locate the main file (e.g., PongFlapMain.pde) and run it.

## Game Instructions

    Use the mouse or keyboard controls to navigate the game.
    The objective is to keep the ball bouncing (Pong) while also avoiding obstacles (Flappy Bird).
    Score points by successfully navigating through obstacles and keeping the ball in play.
